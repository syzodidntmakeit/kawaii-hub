Having lost interest in video games, I found a new hobby; homelabbing. I've decided to turn my gaming PC into a server.

## Prerequisites 

PC Specs:
- Ryzen 5 5600
- 16GB 3600MHz
- Rx 6600 8GB
- 1TB NVMe SSD

It's not perfect for running as a server but it's super overkill for what I want to do.

I've decided to install Arch Linux on it as I'm exhausted with Microsoft's Windows 11, which is an operating system surrounded by office spaces. It's meant to be a user-friendly desktop environment. However it started to lock down on it features, became more proprietary, and who knows how much it knows about me. Thus I've decided to switch. There seems to be a superiority complex around Linux Users, however I suffer from mental illness and does not have an ego. So basically, "No. I'm not better than you because I use Linux."

## Should you?

Unless you're curious, wouldn't mind leaving your comfort and making mistakes, I wouldn't recommend doing this. 
If you want to host your own server, buy an old office PC; OptiPlex, Elitedesk, or you might even have one at home.

With this hobby, I learn how to use Arch Linux in CLI, how to manage services and look cool doing it. If this doesn't interest you, just watch a kid over the internet do it instead.
